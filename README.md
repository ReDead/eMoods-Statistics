# eMoods-Statistics

## Setup

1. Clone the github repository.
2. Go to your emoods app. Navigate to `Settings > Manual Backup > Generate Backup File`. This should give you a `.emoods` file.
3. Get the backup file onto your computer. You can email it to yourself, put it in google drive, etc.
4. Move the `.emoods` file into the root directory of the cloned repository.
5. Extract the file.
    - **For Windows Users:** Run the `extract.bat` file.
    - **For Linux Users:** Run the `extract.sh` file.
    - **If that doesn't work:** Rename the file from `filename.emoods` to `filename.zip` and unzip it like any other zip file into the folder `eMoods-data` within the repository.
